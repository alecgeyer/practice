<p>May 7th</p>
  <p>Article by Reuters on the possible bubble worries but it could be much deeper. 
      there is a host of issues.. the income of the commercial real estate holders 
      has been inflated due to covid and the need to keep the mortgages afloat.</p>

      <p>Commercial real estate remains potentially vulnerable. Since even after the pandemic 
          the demand for office space may still be weak.</p>

    <p> As for the retail the income has gotten inflated and these properties were bought up during covid,
         real estate prices rose massively. So, all the mortgages come in with inflated incomes but there 
         is a selection of mortgages which yield higher premiums as they carry more risk. These are bundled, 
         rated, and sold. Called Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities and there are plenty of CMBS ETFs
          worth total of hundreds of billions, if not over a trillion, on the market. With very large institutional
           holdings. This is leading to institutions facing vulnerability to liquidity risk from maturity transformation. </p>

    <p>The FED released their Financial Stability Report today. Basically saying valuations are high. Equities more than doubled
         the avg annual growth (22.5 to 9%) last year, treasury securities have tripled avg annual growth (26 to 8.3%), high yield
          and unrated bonds have almost quadrupled it (25 to 7.1). Not to mention the risk premiums on high yield unrated bonds
           are to 2008 levels.</p>

    <p>With this said the situation at the moment is better than many feared a year ago. Mortgage defaults are lower than pre pandemic
         levels, business debt is high, but earnings are strong and government support low interest rates. But still, the financial
          stability report warned of potential near term risks to the financial system should the pandemic take a turn for the worse. 
          Clearly the market atm is very fragile.</p>

<p>Many people have started hedging a market failure. 60 million in puts bought on the S&P 500 today 7/16 strike 4000, 7/30 strike 3900, 
    9/17 strike 3100 and 3000 (30+million spent on just 9/17). All in large bulk orders.</p>

    <p>The old saying  “sell in May and go away” could be a good option if a market correction is about to happen</p>
