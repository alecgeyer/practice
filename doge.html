<h1>
    <p>Dogecoin is nearing a 20% chance of hitting $5 in 2021. On the 4th of May it hit a new all-time high of $0.54.
         The reason this crypto has appeal is its potential for massive gains that cannot be found anywhere else. Many
          people are now pilling into all sorts of cryptos as support from billionaires like Elon Musk and Mark Cuban are 
          positive and support their future. Since fundamental analysis of cryptos is fairly vague its more just people 
          following the trend. If people continue hyping this meme crypto then it will continue to climb. There is 
          obviously the risk that when sentiment changes it will start to fall. But so far, it’s had a good run in 2021 
          and longer term has potential to reach $8-$10.
        </p>


          <p>
            On a bullish note, DOGE continued to trade at $0.007 during the start of 2021. Further, it maintained a consolidated trend 
            until the mid of April. Later the price rise was eye-catching with more than 100% rise on consecutive 2 to 3 days. Dogecoin 
            broke its previous price records and progressively hit an All-Time-High of $0.4499 on May 04, 2021, with a historical rally. 
            It might compete with other peer cryptocurrencies by 2021 and might even go up in the ranking. DOGE price might hit the highest 
            level at $1 by the end of 2021.
