<p>May 2021</p>
  <p>Apple Is one of the largest companies in the world, it is safe and boring. It has a very steady uptrend other than 2020 – 2021 when everything was in a massive bull run and it gained 60%. It has always been a top choice for “smart money” investors like warren buffet. </p>

      <p>Recently however, large investors have been trimming position sizes and some completely unloading their positions. Warren buffets Berkshire Hathaway have reduced their position from 1 billion shares in 2020 to under 900 million shares as of now (May 2021).</p>

    <p>This should not worry investors as from Berkshire Hathaway’s point of view they still own the same or more equity in Apple despite the occasional allocation haircut due to Apples share buybacks. Also, Since the last half of 2020 and start of 2021 showed such strong performance, it is understandable to take some gains.</p>

    <p>Apple has been trading at around august 2020 price recently due to inflation worries. But it seems like the inflation worries have now faded or been priced in. Tech in general has seen a little bit more promise in the past week or so. Therefore, it seems like Apple if it can continue the gains it has posted in the past few days it could start to climb higher and test new all-time highs over the $143 price range.</p>

    <p>Apple has been consistently bouncing off its 200-day moving average since 2019. In the past few days, it has been around that level and bounced off. This gives a good technical indication of a move higher. The challenging part will be for shares to break and stay above the low $140s. </p>

<p>Either way depending on your investment strat, if you hold Apple for several years, it is sure to make you some bank. And as for short term it could be looking like a move to test new all-time highs is forming. Calls for 2021-06-18 with 135 strike have had reasonable volume traded recently with 16,200 bought today. </p>
