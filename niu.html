        Niu is an electric scooter manufacturing comapany headquatered in Beijing (which is in china for all geography retards aka therealchurchie).
        NIU has a market cap of around $2.8 billion. Holders of niu include - blackrock, ARK investment and me. Niu became profitable in 2019 and has 
        continued steady growth since posting a $25m profit in 2020 <a href="https://ir.niu.com/node/7271/html"> sec finicial report</a>. Since NIU is
        in a growing sector and already posting profits (unlike NIO Xpeng and other evs) they can reinvest gains for further growth. Some of the ev hype
        from August 2020 may have calmed down but in my opinion niu is a good shout for long term hold.
