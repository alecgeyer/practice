    Westport Fuel Systems Inc. engineers, manufactures, and supplies alternative fuel systems and components for use in transportation applications worldwide.
     It operates through Original Equipment Manufacturer, Independent Aftermarket, and Cummins Westport Inc. (CWI) Joint Venture segments. The company offers 
     alternative fuel systems and components, which include a range of alternative fuels, such as liquefied petroleum gas, compressed natural gas, liquefied 
     natural gas, renewable natural gas, and hydrogen; and independent aftermarket, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and delayed OEMs, electronics, 
     current and advanced research and development programs, supply chain, and product planning activities. Currently it has a market cap of just under $1b
     and for 2020 had an EBITDA of $16m. Westport Fuel Systems WPRT recently announced that it will commence a research project with Scania to apply its high-pressure 
     direct injection (HPDI) 2.0 fuel system using hydrogen to the latter’s latest internal combustion engine (ICE). Preliminary test results will likely be out in the
      second half of 2021., it also has a contract with amazon "Westport Fuel Systems is going to supply Amazon with natural gas engines". This company has big potential
      and contracts to back that. compare it to the likes of fuelcell (market cap $2.79b) and other alternate fuel companies makes this one of my favourite picks for this secotor.
